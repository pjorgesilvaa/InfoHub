## Introduction
This document contains all the info that I could collect along the years that I have been a programmer.
This means that the list will be constantly updated as I find more tools and intersting info.

## FrontEnd

### Javascript Frameworks

#### Angular (Favorite)

<img src='./assets/angular.png' width='1000'>

[Angular](https://angular.io/) (commonly referred to as "Angular 2+" or "Angular CLI") is a TypeScript-based free and open-source web application framework led by the Angular Team at Google and by a community of individuals and corporations. Angular is a complete rewrite from the same team that built AngularJS.

#### Vue

<img src='./assets/vue.png' width='1000'>

[Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/) (commonly referred to as Vue; pronounced "view") is an open-source model‚Äìview‚Äìviewmodel front end JavaScript framework for building user interfaces and single-page applications. It was created by Evan You, and is maintained by him and the rest of the active core team members.

#### React

<img src='./assets/react.jpg' width='1000'>

[React](https://reactjs.org/) (also known as React.js or ReactJS) is a free and open-source front-end JavaScript library for building user interfaces based on UI components. It is maintained by Meta (formerly Facebook) and a community of individual developers and companies. React can be used as a base in the development of single-page or mobile applications. However, React is only concerned with state management and rendering that state to the DOM, so creating React applications usually requires the use of additional libraries for routing, as well as certain client-side functionality.

#### Frontend Mentor

[Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/) provides designs so that you can practice your front-end skills using a real-life workflow. Challenges include designs (both mobile and desktop), assets, and a style guide to get you started.

## BackEnd

### Javascript Environments

#### Node.js

<img src='./assets/nodejs.png' width='1000'>

[Node.js](https://nodejs.org) is an open-source, cross-platform, back-end JavaScript runtime environment that runs on the V8 engine and executes JavaScript code outside a web browser. Node.js lets developers use JavaScript to write command line tools and for server-side scripting‚Äîrunning scripts server-side to produce dynamic web page content before the page is sent to the user's web browser. Consequently, Node.js represents a "JavaScript everywhere" paradigm,[6] unifying web-application development around a single programming language, rather than different languages for server-side and client-side scripts.

### Node.js Frameworks

#### NestJS (Favorite)

<img src='./assets/nestjs.jpg' width='1000'>

[Nest](nestjs.com) (NestJS) is a framework for building efficient, scalable Node.js server-side applications. It uses progressive JavaScript, is built with and fully supports TypeScript (yet still enables developers to code in pure JavaScript) and combines elements of OOP (Object Oriented Programming), FP (Functional Programming), and FRP (Functional Reactive Programming).

#### NEXT JS

<img src='./assets/nextjs.png' width='1000'>

[Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) is an open-source development framework built on top of Node.js enabling React based web applications functionalities such as server-side rendering and generating static websites. React documentation mentions Next.js among "Recommended Toolchains" advising it to developers as a solution when "Building a server-rendered website with Node.js".[4] Traditional React apps render all their content in the client-side browser, Next.js is used to extend this functionality to include applications rendered on the server side.

## Native

### Frontend Framework Toolkits

#### Electron

<img src='./assets/electron.jpg' width='1000'>

[Electron](https://www.electronjs.org/) (formerly known as Atom Shell) is a free and open-source software framework developed and maintained by GitHub. It allows for the development of desktop GUI applications using web technologies: it combines the Chromium rendering engine and the Node.js runtime.

#### Tauri

<img src='./assets/tauri.png' width='1000'>

[Tauri](https://tauri.studio/) is a toolkit that helps developers make applications for the major desktop platforms - using virtually any frontend framework in existence. The core is built with Rust, and the CLI leverages Node.js making Tauri a genuinely polyglot approach to creating and maintaining great apps.
